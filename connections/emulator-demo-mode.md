# Emulator \(DEMO mode\)

An emulator is a special virtual vendor in the list of [Quantower connections](connections-manager.md). It doesn't require an internet to work and can be used even in offline mode.

Its main purpose is to generate quotes locally on your PC in testing and demonstration purposes. Once activated, emulator adds several virtual symbols in [symbols lookup](../getting-started/instruments-lookup.md). You can create orders for these symbols and see how your virtual balance changes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
An emulator can influence the performance of your PC because it requires some amount of processor resources.
